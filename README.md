<!-- ### So, how is this sustainable?

🤷  -->

<!-- **NAIIVE operates on a Sponsorware model.**

While the *Application* is free for everyone, the **Source Code** is available exclusively to Sponsors. This ensures the project's sustainability while keeping the tool free for scientists and students.

## Supported Formats

NAIIVE currently supports the following formats commonly used in my research workflow:

* **LAMMPS:** `.dump` (text dump with `.gz` support)
* **DeepMD:** `deepmd/npy`, `deepmd/raw` (Machine Learning Force Field Datasets)
* **GAMESS:** `.inp` (Input files), log output files
* **VASP:** `POSCAR`
<!-- , `CONTCAR`, `XDATCAR` -->
<!-- * **VASP:** `CHGCAR` (Volumetric data) -->

And these format are planed to support:
* **LAMMPS:** `data` format, as well as thermodynamic output log files
* **xyz**: `xyz` and `extxyz` format
* **VASP**: `OUTCAR`
